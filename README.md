# DriverPass


Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was to create a place that would allow customers to purchase packages to help them better prepare and pass their driver tests. the client was the DriverPass owner and they wanted a website design. 

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did particularly well with the gathering of the buissness requirements from the client.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think if I could revise one part of my work I would improve on my limitations that we would be restricted with while trying to complete our task.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the users needs based off what the client instructed me on what they wanted this is important because you want to create a product that is satisfactory to the client and will speak well on behalf of our company and our work.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach softwear design as a sequence of events i build one piece at a time until i have a whole project and then begin to improve its effeciency after. I would later ensure i have a checklist of the clients requirements and ensure that i am accomplishing these tasks as i am building the software.
